Healthcare Premium Prediction
This project predicts healthcare premium amounts based on user-specific features like age, income, medical history, and more. By leveraging machine learning, the model estimates premiums, helping users understand expected healthcare costs.

Use Case
Users can input the following features to predict their healthcare premium:

Age
Number of Dependents
Income (in Lakhs)
Genetic Risk
Insurance Plan
Employment Status
Gender
Marital Status
BMI Category
Smoking Status
Region
Medical History
The model processes these inputs and provides an estimated premium amount.

Steps Involved
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyzed the data with statistical summaries and visualizations.
Identified trends, correlations, and outliers.
Feature Engineering

Handled missing data and encoded categorical variables.
Scaled numerical features and created new features to improve performance.
Model Training and Optimization

Tested Linear Regression and XGBoost models for prediction.
Used RandomizedSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning to select the best-performing model.
Error Analysis

Evaluated the model using metrics like RMSE and RÂ².
Identified and addressed areas of underperformance.
Model Segmentation

Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Applied cross-validation to ensure the model performs well on unseen data.
Model Deployment

Deployed the trained model using Streamlit for a user-friendly web interface.
Users can input their data and view the predicted premium in real-time.
Technologies Used
Python: Main programming language
Pandas: Data manipulation and cleaning
